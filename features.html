				<ol>
					<li>Simple applicability</li>
					The most important goal of STAG is simple applicability. The sensor developer himself should have no or as little effort as possible to connect his 
					   sensor to STAG and thus also to the IT world. A sensor should register with STAG and then automatically become visible to the IT world via the interface 
					   and accessible to other systems.
					<li>Independence from specific sensor systems</li>
					In order to make the applicability as high as possible and to keep the configuration effort as low as possible, STAG is developed in such a way that it is 
						independent of concrete sensor characteristics. STAG can support different sensor systems with different measurement values and properties "out-of-the-box". 
						This is achieved through the use of a sensor description, such as is already provided for in the Lightweight Machine to Machine Standard (LwM2M) or in the 
						Bluetooth GATT profiles (Generic Attribute Profile).
					<li>Modular and expandable design to support different standards on both sensor and IT side</li>
					The system structure of STAG has been chosen in such a way that STAG itself can be extended by various technology or protocol adapters. This modular structure 
					makes it possible to add further interfaces to STAG at a later date or to switch variably between different protocols.
					<li>Common understanding and data model of sensor systems and sensor information</li>
					In order for sensor information and data to be translated and transformed between different protocols and standards, a uniform definition of sensor 
					information is necessary. This central data model is used as a common core of the different technology and protocol adapters and significantly 
					facilitates the translation between different technologies, as only one mapping into the central data model is required per technology or protocol 
					and not n mappings into n supported technologies.
					<li>Central translation technology for mapping between different data models</li>
					The heart of STAG is the aforementioned common central data model. As with humans, the heart is of no use without the veins that ensure the flow of blood to and 
					from the heart. In STAG, translation technology takes on the role of the veins. It makes it possible for the data coming from the sensors to be mapped into the 
					common data model and then forwarded from there to the data adapters, which then make the data available to the higher systems in the IT world via specific interfaces.
