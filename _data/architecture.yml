    ## Split into three

    STAG system is logically spilt into three main parts: 
    1. **Technology Adapter Implementation** - various modules 
    that implement specific communication protocols that 
    create  `Device` abstractions for the internal 
    information model.
    2. **Core** - internal modules that provide the base 
    functionality for the system as a whole.
    3. **Data Consumer Adapter Implementations** - various 
    modules that provide access to the internal information 
    model and the stored `Device` abstractions.

    ## Expandable at runtime
    System administrators can add new **Technology Adapter** and 
    **Data Consumer Adapter Implementations** without shuting down 
    the system. The only part that is not expandable at runtime is the **Core**.

    ## Custom model for simpler access

    STAG System defines a custom `Device` abstraction which allows 
    **Technology Adapter Implementations** to model data so it is 
    accessible to all **Data Consumer Adapter Implementations**
