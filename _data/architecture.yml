    ## Split into three

    STAG system is logically spilt into three main parts: 
    1. **Technology Adapter Implementation** - various modules 
    that implement specific communication protocols that 
    create  `Device` abstractions for the internal 
    information model.
    2. **Core** - internal modules that provide the base 
    functionality for the system as a whole.
    3. **Data Consumer Adapter Implementations** - various 
    modules that provide access to the internal information 
    model and the stored `Device` abstractions.

    ## Expandable at runtime
    System administrators can add new **Technology Adapter** and 
    **Data Consumer Adapter Implementations** without shuting down 
    the system. The only part that is not expandable at runtime is the **Core**.

    ## Systems heart and soul

    The heart of STAG is the aforementioned common central data model. 
    As with humans, the heart is of no use without the veins that ensure 
    the flow of blood to and from the heart. 
    
    In STAG, translation technology takes on the role of the veins. 
    
    It makes it possible for the data coming from the sensors to be mapped 
    into the common data model and then forwarded from there to the data 
    adapters, which then make the data available to the higher systems in 
    the IT world via specific interfaces.

    ## Custom model for simpler access

    STAG System defines a custom `Device` abstraction which allows 
    **Technology Adapter Implementations** to model data so it is 
    accessible to all **Data Consumer Adapter Implementations**
