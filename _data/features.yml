    Factory engineers should have to spend as little 
    effort as possible to connect a new sensor to **STAG** system
    and thus to the IT world. Individual sensor systems are 
    automatically registered and become visible to the IT world.

    **STAG** has been designed from the ground up to be a modular
    system. This structure makes it possible to add new interfaces 
    to sensor systems or cloud based solutions at a later date 
    without having to stop the system.

    **STAG** is completely written in *C++17* with 
    [Cmake](https://cmake.org/){:target="_blank"} as its build automation
    tool and [conan](https://conan.io/){:target="_blank"} for 
    dependency management. Thus enabling support for a
    wide range of systems while still offering modern *C++* features.

    **STAG** can be executed on Linux, Windows and Mac machines. 
    Additionally, it is compatible with both *x86* and *ARM* 
    architectures, thus it is able to work on both small embedded 
    Linux devices like Raspberry and large backend servers.
