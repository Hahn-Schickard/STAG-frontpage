Working in close partnership with the industry, [Hahn-Schickard](https://www.hahn-schickard.de){:target="_blank"} provides innovative products and technologies in the areas of sensors and actuators, system integration, cyber-physical systems, communication technology, software development, lab-on-a-chip and analytics, microelectronics, mounting and connection technology, micromounting, and reliability. Our services include the production of small and medium-sized series, as well as the transition to mass production.  

[Data models and aggregation](https://www.hahn-schickard.de/en/research-development/communication-technology-iot/data-models-data-integration){:target="_blank"} combined with [technology gateways](https://www.hahn-schickard.de/en/service-portfolio/research-development/information-technology/gateways){:target="_blank"} are main research and development topics of Hahn-Schickards Software Solutions department. STAG is one of results of these activities and has its root in multiple research projects (e.g. the [Non-Disruptive Evaluation Kit für Industrie 4.0 – NIKI 4.0](http://fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik.github.io/NIKI40/){:target="_blank"} ). STAG and its predecessors have allready been applied in different projects simplifying the integration of sensors into an OPC UA data model and interface.

The STAG development is currently driven by a sub group oft the Application Engineering group. As a public available Open Source projects the development is not limited to Hahn-Schickard.
